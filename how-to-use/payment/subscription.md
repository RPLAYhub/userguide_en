## Subscription System Guide

On RPLAY, you can subscribe to creators’ tiered plans with a monthly recurring payment.

***

## Subscription Perks

* Monthly recurring support for creators
* Exclusive content and benefits based on subscription tiers  
  * Subscriber-only content, live streams, emotes, messaging privileges, etc.
* Tier badges and subscription duration icons  
  * Displayed next to your nickname in comments and chats

{% hint style="info" %}
- Even a free tier subscription lets you access free subscriber-only content or get upload notifications.
- Benefits vary by tier, so check what’s included before subscribing!
- Depending on the creator’s settings, some tiers only let you view content posted **after your subscription starts** (strict subscription).  
  Content from before your subscription isn’t viewable, but you can keep watching new content until you cancel.  
  Example:  
  - If you start subscribing in July, content from June or earlier isn’t viewable.  
  - If you stay subscribed until November, you can view content from July to November.  
  - If you cancel in December, all previously viewable content becomes inaccessible.

## Subscription Payments

* The initial subscription fee is charged on the payment date, and it renews every 1st of the month with the registered card.
* Subscription periods are set to a monthly cycle to match creators who produce/provide content monthly, so 30-day renewals aren’t available.
* If a renewal payment fails, subscription privileges are lost.  
  * Resubscribing within the same month restores your continuous subscription period.
* New subscriptions aren’t available the day before renewal.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">Renewals happen on the 1st of each month</mark>, so subscribing late in the month might mean losing privileges soon after.  

We recommend subscribing early in the month if possible!
{% endhint %}

## Canceling Subscriptions

You can request to cancel your subscription before the next renewal, and it won’t renew the following month.

### How to Cancel a Subscription

1. Go to My Page > Subscribed Channels > “Manage Subscription” button, or visit the channel page you want to unsubscribe from and click the “Subscribed” button.
2. Select the tier you want to cancel and hit the “Subscribed” button to complete the cancellation request.
3. Even after requesting cancellation, this month’s subscription privileges remain active until the end of the month.
