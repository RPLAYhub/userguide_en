## RPLAY Coins

* RPLAY Coins are **the currency used within RPLAY**.
* Use them freely for buying paid content, live tickets, supporting creators (via chats, roulette, missions, etc.), sending messages, or subscribing to coins in the app.
* Content purchased with coins, including replays, is stored in your purchase history and available until you leave RPLAY.
* Coins can be bought on both the RPLAY web and app, with extra store fees applied for app purchases.
* A 10% VAT is added when buying coins, and purchased coins are valid for 5 years from the purchase date.
* Check your earned and spent coins at [`My Info - Coin History`](https://rplay.live/myinfo/?toWhere=coin-usage).

## Bonus Coins

* Bonus Coins are given as a bonus when charging coins or handed out for free during events. They work the same as RPLAY Coins.
* Whether Bonus Coins can be used depends on the creator’s settings, and if usable, they’re deducted first.
* Curious about content you can use Bonus Coins on? Search for ‘<mark style="color:blue;">`Bonus Coins`</mark>’ in the search bar.
* Some items like subscriptions or certain support options can’t be paid with Bonus Coins.
