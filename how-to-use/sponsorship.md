{% hint style="info" %}
For free broadcasts, sponsorship allows you to watch in 1080p quality. (Not applicable if the creator streams in 720p.)
{% endhint %}

### Chat Sponsorship

When you send a chat sponsorship, your message will be highlighted in the chat window. Depending on the creator's settings, it may also appear on the broadcast screen with TTS (Text-to-Speech) enabled.

### Roulette Sponsorship

This sponsorship spins a roulette wheel set by the creator, applying preset amounts, items, and probabilities.

### Mission Sponsorship

Mission sponsorship allows you to propose a challenge to the creator along with a reward amount.

Creators can accept or decline missions and set a minimum sponsorship amount. If a mission is canceled midway, a cancellation fee set by the creator may apply.

### Lovense Sponsorship

If the creator has Lovense integration enabled, `Chat Sponsorship` can activate their connected Bluetooth adult device.

By sending a chat sponsorship with the appropriate coin amount, you can control the device’s intensity, duration, and movement pattern according to the creator’s settings.
