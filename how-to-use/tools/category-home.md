# Category Home Settings

## What Are Category Home Settings?

> A feature that lets you set your favorite category page in RPLAY as your homepage.  
> If you only want to see creators and content you love, set that page as your homepage now!

* When you set a page as your homepage, it becomes your default landing spot on RPLAY.  
  * Visiting rplay.live or tapping the RPLAY logo in the top left takes you to your custom homepage instead of the default one.
* Audio fans can set the ASMR/Voice page as their homepage, VTuber fans can pick the VTUBER page, and so on.
