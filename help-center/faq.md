{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Using the Service" %}
* **I think I ran into a bug while using the service.**\
  : If you spot a bug on RPLAY, let us know the details via [Submit a Support Request](https://forms.gle/S7N4FiEjyPyWQT3U9). We’ll fix it as fast as we can!\
  &#xNAN;_&#x53;ome simple issues might clear up with a refresh, re-login, or clearing your cache and reconnecting._
* **How do I use Bonus Coins?**\
  : Bonus Coins are goodies you get when charging coins or from events. Whether they’re usable depends on the content—when they are, they get used up first. Curious what content takes Bonus Coins? Just search ‘Bonus Coins’ in the search bar!
* **What’s the difference between buying coins and subscribing?**\
  : **Coin purchases** let you permanently own access to specific content, so you can watch it anytime, no expiration. **Subscriptions** give you monthly access to a channel’s content—watchable only for the months you’re subscribed. Benefits vary by tier, and if you cancel, you lose access starting the next month. Creators might limit what’s viewable based on their settings.
* **What happens if a creator deletes content I bought?**\
  : Even if a creator deletes content or leaves RPLAY, anything you bought with coins stays in your purchase history and remains viewable. _Yes, even if the creator’s gone, you can still watch it via your purchase list!_
* **Videos on the web look mosaiced or blurred.**\
  : Turn on the 19+ button at the top of the page!
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Payments & Refunds" %}
* **How do I get a refund?**\
  : Please submit your request through [Submit a Support Request](https://forms.gle/S7N4FiEjyPyWQT3U9).
  * Purchases made by mistake aren’t refundable.
  * Partial refunds aren’t available if you’ve used some of your charged coins.
  * If you’ve played the content, it can’t be refunded.
  * Include your RPLAY ID and order number with your payment details when requesting a refund.
  * For app purchases, contact our support team—we’ll guide you through the process!
* **Aren’t there more payment options available?**\
  : We’re working hard to add more payment methods for your convenience, but RPLAY’s unique nature makes it tricky to include tons of options. We’re still trying, so thanks for your patience!
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Subscriptions" %}
* **When’s the subscription payment date?**\
  : **It’s every 1st of the month.** RPLAY’s recurring subscriptions run on UTC, so payments renew every 1st based on that time zone. This fits creators who make/provide content monthly. Even if you subscribe late in the month, renewal hits on the 1st of the next month—keep that in mind!
* **I just subscribed, but I got charged again already.**\
  : RPLAY’s subscription isn’t a 30-day cycle—it’s a **monthly plan renewing on the 1st**. Many creators drop content monthly, and subscriptions cover that month’s content. For example, subscribing on March 25th gives you March content, then April 1st charges for April’s. If you haven’t watched anything after renewal and want a refund, use [**Submit a Support Request**](https://forms.gle/S7N4FiEjyPyWQT3U9).
* **Why can’t I subscribe at the end of the month or early on the 1st?**\
  : It’s to prevent unwanted double charges and confusion from time zone differences. RPLAY renews subscriptions on the 1st morning UTC. Since creators work monthly, subscribing late still triggers a renewal on the 1st. Please wait a bit and try again!
* **How do I cancel my subscription?**\
  : Go to **`My Info`** > `Subscribed Channels`, hit the `Manage Subscription` button for the creator you want to cancel, pick the tier, and click `Cancel Subscription`. Even after canceling, your perks last until the end of the month, then stop the next month. (Note: Cancellation is only available on the web.)
* **I subscribed, but I can’t see the content.**\
  : Available content varies by tier, and some might still require a coin purchase even if you’re subscribed. Double-check the viewing rights for the content you want!
* **The subscription details don’t match what’s provided.**\
  : Reach out to the creator or submit details to our support team.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="App Usage" %}
* **Why are coin prices different in the app?**\
  : Play Store and App Store policies add about a 30% fee—sorry for the inconvenience!
* **I can’t see content in the app.**\
  : To view all content in the app, go to `My Info` via a web browser and turn ON `Show 19+ Content in App`!
* **Features on the web aren’t in the app.**\
  : RPLAY started as a web service and is gradually adding features to the app. For now, please use the web browser for anything not yet in the app—sorry for the hassle!
* **I think there’s a bug in the app.**\
  : If you hit a bug in the RPLAY app, report it via [**Submit a Support Request**](https://forms.gle/S7N4FiEjyPyWQT3U9). We’ll tackle it ASAP!\
  &#xNAN;_&#x53;ometimes force closing and reopening or reinstalling fixes it._
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Miscellaneous" %}
* **How do I delete my account?**\
  : Tap the account deletion button at the bottom of the ‘My Info’ page to start the process. After deletion, all active subscriptions cancel, and no refunds are given for remaining subscription periods or coins. You’ll also lose access to all purchased content—**it can’t be restored**, so decide carefully!
* **I want to be a creator—how do I start?**\
